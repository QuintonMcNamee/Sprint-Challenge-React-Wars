1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

The problems React JS tries to solve have to do with efficiency. Other libraries like React JS as well as other frameworks allow developers to work much more efficiently. They handle the grunt work which allows developers more time to spend on more complex problems. For example, the american football scoreboard project would have taken ages longer without react. We would have had to write separate CSS and HTML files.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

It means to develop in a way that utilizes reacts strength. For example, while you are developing, think about how you could turn something into a component.

3. Describe state.

State is simply data. Like strings, arrays, objects, etc.

4. Describe props.

Props is short for properties and we pass these to our components to give them the information they need.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

React can be weird. Sometimes a component can return a different output for the same thing. Or when you get data from an API it can loop infinitely. You need to use useEffect or other similar hooks to deal with this weirdness.
